Chapter 1: Understanding Emotional Intelligence
===============================================

Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize and manage one's own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. In conversational AI, emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly important as chatbots are expected to provide more personalized and empathetic interactions. In this chapter, we will explore the definition of emotional intelligence, its importance in communication, and the different aspects of emotional intelligence.

In communication, emotional intelligence plays a critical role in building rapport, establishing trust, and creating meaningful connections with others.
